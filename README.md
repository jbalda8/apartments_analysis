# Data Science Portfolio Project
The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize data about 1 bedroom apartments in the Indianapolis, IN area. Data was web scraped from apartments.com using a python package called scrapy. Many of those files can be seen in apartments_scraper folder. Within this folder there is another folder called spiders, and within that folder you will see a python file called apartmentSpider.py. This is the actual code that scrapes and creates the json file you see in the repository. Scrapy is recommended to be done in a virtual environment, so one was created using the Linux terminal. The files for the virtual environment are not provided.

You will see a jupyter notebook called webScrape that holds the analysis and visualization part of this project.
